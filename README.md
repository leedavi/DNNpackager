# DNNpackager

This crude console application will package a DNN module into an Install zip file.

This is a replacement for MSBuild and is not as far reaching as MSBUILD, but is independant to Visual Studio and simple.

You activate the build by runnig from the windows prompt, through the VS post compile event or through a Visual Studio External tool.

It requires 1 parameter which is the root folder of the module.

Example:
C:\\DNNpackager.exe C:\Websites\www\DesktopModules\DNNtestModules\testproject

It should also have a configuration file in the module root folder called "DNNpackager.dnnpack".

Example:
```xml
<root>
	<version>1.0.0</version>
	<!-- Include only files that match the regular expression -->
	<regexpr>(\.cshtml|\.html|\.resx|\.dnn|\.png|\.css|\.js|\.xml|\.txt|\.md)$</regexpr>
	<directory include='false'>
		<!-- Folders that will NOT be placed into the installation zip -->
		<!-- All paths should be from the source root (project root) -->
		<value>\.git</value>
		<value>\.vs</value>
		<value>\bin</value>
		<value>\Componants</value>
		<value>\Documentation</value>
		<value>\Examples</value>
		<value>\Interfaces</value>
		<value>\obj</value>
		<value>\packages</value>
		<value>\Providers</value>
		<value>\Theme</value>
	</directory>
	<file include='true'>
		<!-- Extra files that need to be inclued. -->
		<!-- All paths should be from the source root (project root) -->
		<value></value>
	</file>
	<!-- The bin path gives the backward folder levels to the DNN bin folder, so assemblies can be taken. -->
	<!-- In some cases, if the project folder is not under a company level, this will need to be change. -->
	<binfolder>\\..\\..\\..\\bin</binfolder>
	<assembly>
		<!-- Assembllies will be taken from the DNN bin folder, and placed on root. -->
		<value>test.dll</value>
	</assembly>
</root>
```

Installation
------------

There is currently no installation package.  But if you're running Visual Studio with DNN, the chances are you already have any dependancies.

So simply download the release exe or the source code form GITHUB and setup in a suitable directory.

Setup in Visual Studio
